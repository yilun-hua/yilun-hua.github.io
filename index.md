# About Me

My name is **Yilun Hua**. 

I’m a rising second-year Computer Science PhD student at Cornell University, advised by Yoav Artzi. My research interests include dialogues and multi-turn interactions, foundation models’ reasoning capabilities, multimodal tasks, and communication efficiency. I’m also completing a minor in cognitive science and like to think about its relevance to AI research. 

At Cornell, I also worked with Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, focusing on summarizing conversation dynamics. I received my BA in Computer Science and Mathematics-Statistics from Columbia University, where I primarily worked with Kathleen McKeown.

Outside of research, I like spending time learning about art history, listening to music from the Romantic period, and enjoying performing arts in general.
